        Hi! My name is Lucas. I am a software engineer and most recently I ive been working at a startup called Rokt,
        where I work on K8s infrastructure, developing scalable go microservices, and improving the developer
        experience.

        I made this website to document and share some of the coding and 3d printing projects Iâ€™ve worked on.
        Thanks for visiting!
